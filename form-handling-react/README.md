# Form Handling in React

This project demonstrates two approaches to managing form data in React:

1. **Controlled Components** – Using React's `useState` to manage form input values manually.
2. **Formik** – Using Formik and Yup for advanced form handling and validation.

## Features
- User Registration Form with fields for **username**, **email**, and **password**
- Basic validation with controlled components
- Advanced validation with Formik + Yup
- Mock API simulation on form submission

## Project Setup
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
